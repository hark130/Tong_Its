# Tong_Its
Command line replication of the Filipino card game ["Tong Its"](https://www.pagat.com/rummy/tong-its.html) in C++


## Why?
* I haven't programmed anything in a while (I'm supposed to be on vacation)
* I could use some practice in C++
* My wife always beats me and I want to test out some algorithmic strategies


## How?
g++ --std=c++11 -I include source/Tong_Its.cpp main.cpp -o game
./game
